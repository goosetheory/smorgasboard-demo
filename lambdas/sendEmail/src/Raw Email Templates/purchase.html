						Dear {given_name},
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Thanks for your purchase. We're glad you've chosen us for your next event. We're sending along some details on how to use SmorgasBoard to make sure your event is a big success.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p><b>Before your event</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Your board is where all your photos will be shown, and also has a QR code for guests to scan when they want to add a photo. Give it a fun name, if you haven't already! You can do that <a href="{create_board_link}">here</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Make sure you'll be able to display your board on the day of your event. Your venue will need a TV or projector you can connect a computer to. You'll also need an internet connection so you can display photos as they're added.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p><b>Day-of</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Connect your computer to the internet, and hook it up to your venue's TV/projector. Connect it to your venue's wifi and navigate to <a href="{all_boards_link}">your board</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Click the "Launch Board" button when you're ready to start the board. You'll be able to add photos for 48 hours. Then, click the "Open Board" button to show the board fullscreen on your TV/projector. You'll see an empty board with a QR code.
						</li>
						<li>
							Let your guests know they can scan the QR code with their phones to take a photo.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<p><b>After the event</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Look for an email from us for digital copies of your photos. It should arrive within a day or two.
						</li>
					</ul>
